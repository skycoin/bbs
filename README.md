Skycoin BBS uses the [Skycoin CX Object System](https://github.com/skycoin/cxo) (CXO) to store and synchronise data between nodes and the [Skycoin Messenger](https://github.com/skycoin/net) (net) for inter-node content submission.

## Install

### Go 1.9+ Installation and Setup

[Golang 1.9+ Installation/Setup](https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin/blob/develop/Installation.md)

After installation, ensure that the `GOPATH` environmental variable is set and that `$GOPATH/bin` is added to the `PATH` environment variable.

### Dependencies

Dependencies are managed with [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep).

To install `dep`:

```sh
go get -u github.com/golang/dep
```

`dep` vendors all dependencies into the repo.

### Download and Compile BBS Executables

```sh
go get https://github.com/skycoin/bbs/...
```

This will download `github.com/skycoin/bbs` to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/skycoin/bbs`.

You can also clone the repo directly with `git clone https://github.com/skycoin/bbs`,
but it must be cloned to this path: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/skycoin/bbs`.
